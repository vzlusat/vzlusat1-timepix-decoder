Corrupted image, looks like the sensor power fluctuated which reseted its settings. Thus every pixel outputs > 255 value.

400
The first UV triggered image. However, no photons, possibly some reflection...?
401
Adrenalin mode, the second UV triggered exposure, just 81 seconds apart from another one (402).
402
Adrenalin mode, the third UV triggered exposure, just 81 seconds apart from the previous one (401).
403
Due to broken planner script, this is not planned adrenaline. But, still the fourth UV triggered exposure.
404
Due to broken planner script, this is not planned adrenaline. But, still the fifth UV triggered exposure.
